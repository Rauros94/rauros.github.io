## ðŸ§  Context

This assignment involved the analysis of functional requirements for a university library system and the modeling of its core components using UML class diagrams. The design includes resources (spaces and books), users (students and teachers), and the different types of reservations possible in the system.

## âœ… Summary

This UML class diagram captures a simplified model for a university library resource booking system. It applies object-oriented design principles such as generalization and composition and supports potential rule extension based on user type or resource restrictions.

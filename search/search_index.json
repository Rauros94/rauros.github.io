The design includes resources (spaces and books), users (students and teachers), and the different types of reservations possible in the system. \ud83d\uddbc UML Class Diagram The following UML class diagram represents the designed structure of the library reservation system. \ud83e\udde9 Class Descriptions Class Description Space General class representing a physical resource in the library. ReadingSeat Subclass of Space . StudyRoom Subclass of Space . User General class representing any individual who interacts with the library. Student Subclass of User , with the attribute degree : string . Teacher Subclass of User , with the attribute department : string . Book Represents a library book, with attributes fecha : Date and soloLecturaSala : Boolean . Indicates whether the book is restricted to in-room reading only. SpaceReservation Represents the reservation of a space (seat or room) by a user, with attribute Date . RoomReservation Subclass of SpaceReservation , used for study rooms. SeatReservation Subclass of SpaceReservation , used for reading seats. BookReservation Represents a book reservation, with attribute RoomOnly : Boolean . Indicates if a room reservation is required to allow the book reservation. \ud83d\udd17 Class Hierarchies (Generalization) Generalization Description User <> Student Student is a subclass of User . User <> Teacher Teacher is a subclass of User . Space <> StudyRoom StudyRoom is a subclass of Space . Space <> ReadingSeat ReadingSeat is a subclass of Space . SpaceReservation <> RoomReservation RoomReservation is a subclass of SpaceReservation . SpaceReservation <> SeatReservation SeatReservation is a subclass of SpaceReservation . \ud83d\udd17 Class Associations Association Description Student <> RoomReservation Students can create room reservations. Teacher <> RoomReservation Teachers can create room reservations. User <> SeatReservation Users can reserve reading seats. User <> BookReservation Users can reserve books. SeatReservation <> ReadingSeat Each seat reservation is linked to a specific reading seat. RoomReservation <> StudyRoom Each room reservation is linked to a specific study room. BookReservation <> Book Each book reservation is linked to a specific book. BookReservation <> SeatReservation Book reservations validate the presence of an active seat reservation to allow access to the requested book. \u2705 Summary This UML class diagram captures a simplified model for a university library resource booking system. It applies object-oriented design principles such as generalization and composition and supports potential rule extension based on user type or resource restrictions.","title":"UML Class Diagram - Library Resource Management System"},{"location":"UML-Class-Diagram-Library-Resource-Management-System/#context","text":"This assignment involved the analysis of functional requirements for a university library system and the modeling of its core components using UML class diagrams.
